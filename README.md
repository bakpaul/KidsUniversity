# Kid's University 

This project has been done for a project in collaboration with Strasbourg University. The project is called Kid's University and its purpose is to introduce robotics to young students (13-14 years old). 

It is alittle game representing a labyrinth. The goal is to go from D to A by giving simple orders. If the user make the robot go into a wall or an obstacle, he gains "points", the goal beiing to have as few points as possible. 
The game can also be solved authomatically by adding a *a* at the end of the running command.
